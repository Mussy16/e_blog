                              <h2>How to create an online course: a step by step guide</h2>
                              <p>In this article, we will explore online course creation step-by-step guide to help you craft the course that is relevant, engaging, and as a result - successful..</p>

                              <blockquote>There are many instructional system design models.</blockquote>

                              <p>Storyboards plot out eLearning course content, structure, and the overall flow.
                                   Building a storyboard is great practice for instructional designers when determining what media to utilize in your online course as it gives you the opportunity to think about how and where elements will fit into the course.
                                   It will also help you with determining whether you have considered all necessary content to include in your course.
                                   In order for content to be presented effectively, it is essential for it to be accurately prepared.
                                   Instructional techniques need to be developed creatively through an engaging and motivating learning experience.
                                   </p>
                                   <p><b>Content can consist of many different elements ranging from documents and presentations to interactive simulations and job aids.</b></p>
                                   <p>This post will mainly focus on the development of interactive lessons, which is the most common form of developing eLearning content. Interactive content allows for eLearning developers and instructional designers to use a variety of techniques and media.
                                        It is very likely that most of the content for the course you are creating is already available.
                                        Some examples of already made content may include:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                             <li>User manuals</li>
                                             <li>Course handouts</li>
                                             <li>Slideshow presentations</li>
                                             <li>Documented case studies</li>
                                             <li>Training materials</li>
                                             <li>Illustrative materials, such as:
                                                  <ol>photographs</ol>
                                                  <ol>images</ol>
                                                  <ol>graphs</ol>
                                                  <ol>tables</ol>
                                                  </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>It is important to note that ready-made materials must be carefully designed and structured in alignment with instructional support in order to allow learners to function independently throughout the course</p>

                                        <img src="images/story.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                                        <p>Content needs to be structured and presented in a way that it engages the learner as well as facilitates learning at the same time.</p>
                                        <p>In order for both of these components to be achieved, you need to use instructional techniques, media, and interactive elements through the development of storyboards.</p>
                                        <p> <b>This section will discuss how to develop storyboards for the interactive lessons that you will be creating. Storyboards are a visual representation that describes screen by screen what will happen in the lesson.</b></p>
                                        <p>For each lesson it is essential to:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                             <li>Review the provided content</li>
                                             <li>Select appropriate instructional techniques to present the content</li>
                                             <li>Determine the sequence of the lesson</li>
                                             <li>Create a storyboard that specifies which elements will appear in each screen of the lesson</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Below is an example of a storyboard created with PowerPoint. However, storyboards can also be created through the use of word documents.</p>

                                        <h2>Structuring an Interactive Module</h2>
                                        <p>Storyboarding compares well to a blueprint in that the scope of the project is detailed. Every person who views the blueprint should be able to see how all the pieces fit together.
                                             Storyboarding should include more than just laying out the sketch or the script of the story; rather, a storyboard should include information on lighting, music, or any other component of the multimedia presentation.
                                             By viewing the project in its entirety prior to creating it, you can more easily catch errors and plan for solutions just like an architect can add windows or doors to a plan once a blueprint is complete.
                                             Storyboarding is not limited to one document. There may be several documents that come together to complete a storyboard just as there are with blueprints.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>When creating a storyboard for an interactive lesson, you need to organize the content into a sequence of slides that correspond to the screens of the final interactive lesson.
                                                  Here are some examples:
                                                  </p>

                                                  <p>There are numerous working parts when it comes to organizing and creating content for eLearning or online lessons.</p>
                                                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                                  <p>Actual course creation can be tricky, but if you know your audience and core message, you will just need the right people for the corresponding roles – eLeanring specialists will do the rest when you’re good with the basics.
                                                       After your first run through the steps outlined in this post for online course creation, it will become increasingly easier to build future courses.</p>

                                                 <p>Digital citizenship refers to the responsible use of technology by anyone who uses computers, the Internet, and digital devices to engage with society on any level. 

                                                  As the rate of technological advancement continues to increase, the world as a whole is becoming more dependent on the Internet for day-to-day activities. That makes this a crucial topic to teach today’s students.</p>   
                                                  <p>Good digital citizenship for students engages them and shows them how to connect with one another, empathize with each other, and create lasting relationships through digital tools.</p>
                                                  <p>Bad digital citizenship, on the other hand, entails cyberbullying, irresponsible social media usage, and a general lack of knowledge about how to safely use the Internet.

                                                       Fortunately, almost all of the requirements to be a good digital citizen can be taught in the classroom.</p>

Digital citizenship education aims to prepare students to engage in communities online for personal, professional, and educational purposes while safeguarding their own and others' wellbeing
                                                       
                                                       . It is important to teach students digital citizenship to protect themselves from internet dangers and respect each other's human rights
                                                       
                                                       . By teaching digital citizenship, individuals become more aware of internet safety and learn how to use their knowledge, skills, and understanding to protect and promote human rights online, such as freedom, privacy, and security
                                                       
                                                       . In conclusion, digital citizenship is essential in today's society, and it is crucial to teach it in schools to prepare students for the future.</p>
                                                       <p>During Digital Citizenship Week, I learned about the importance of equipping students with the skills to engage positively, critically, and competently in digital environments. This includes understanding concepts such as empathy, digital literacy, digital wellness, and the digital divide. I also gained insights into the significance of teaching digital citizenship as a normal part of the curriculum, similar to citizenship, character development, and behavior plans. Additionally, I discovered the emphasis on promoting students' mental health and digital well-being, as well as the role of educators and parents in fostering responsible and ethical behavior in the digital realm. Overall, the week provided valuable information and resources for promoting digital literacy and online safety among students and families.</p>
